# 🦸‍♂️ Hero School — Episode 1: *First Day Chaos*

It was my first day at **Hero School**.
I was not ready. I was never ready for school.

The big gate said:

> “Welcome, new heroes! Power comes with homework.”

I wanted to go home.

Inside, everything was strange.
One boy could fly, another boy was invisible,
and one cat was reading a book.
Yes — a **cat** was reading a book!

Our teacher was **Mr. Koschei**.
He was very old, very thin, and very scary.
He said, “I am not dead. I am *almost* dead.”
Everyone laughed. I did not.

In the next room, **Harry Potter** tried to teach magic.
He sneezed, and the window exploded.
“Oops,” he said, “that was not in the plan.”

Then I saw **Freddy Krueger**.
He said, “I teach *Dream Safety*.”
He smiled. Nobody smiled back.

At lunch we had “Hero Soup.”
It was green and it moved.
The soup said, “Eat me, hero.”
I looked at it and said, “No, thank you.”

My new friend **Tony** sat next to me.
He was nice, but strange.
When he sneezes, electricity comes out of his nose.
He sneezed. The table was on fire.
Everybody shouted, “Water! Water!”

After lunch we had our first **Power Test**.
Harry flew around the room.
Freddy disappeared in the air.
Koschei turned his chair into gold.

Then the teacher looked at me.
“What is your power?” he asked.

I said, “I can write very fast!”
The class was quiet.
Then the teacher smiled and said,

> “Good. Every hero needs a writer.”

So now I am not a fighter.
I am a **hero writer**.
It is safe. Mostly.

At the end of the day the fire alarm rang again.
Tony sneezed. The wall was smoking.
Harry shouted, “Not again!”

Tomorrow we have **Flying Lesson**.
I hope the soup stays in the kitchen this time.

# 🧹 Hero School — Episode 2: *Dorm Disaster*

Morning at Hero School is loud.
Very loud.

My roommate **Tony** wakes up and sneezes electricity again.
“Good morning,” I say.
He says, “Oops.”
The **lamp** is on fire.

The dorm smells like **smoke** and **toast**.
Our **breakfast** is on the floor.
The **milk** is dancing, the **bread** is black, and the **spoon** is stuck in the wall.
I think this is normal here.

In the hall, **Harry Potter** runs with a **broom**.
He says, “Flying class in five minutes!”
I still wear my **pajamas**.
He waves his wand—boom!—now I wear my **uniform**.
It is too small.
My **pants** cry for help.

Downstairs, we eat “Power Cereal.”
It moves in the **bowl**.
One piece says, “Save the world!”
Another says, “Add more sugar!”
I just smile and eat quietly.

At class, **Mr. Koschei** is angry.
Someone drew a **mustache** on his face in a **picture** on the wall.
He shouts, “Who did this?!”
Everyone points at Freddy Krueger.
Freddy smiles: “It was a dream, sir.”

Then we study **history of heroes**.
I try to write, but my **pen** turns into a small **snake**.
It hisses, “No homework today.”
I like this snake.

After class we clean the **room**.
The **floor** is wet, the **table** is broken, and Tony sneezes again.
The **window** is gone.
The air is cold but fresh.

At night, we are tired.
Tony says, “I think we are great heroes.”
I say, “We are alive. That’s already great.”

Then the **light** goes out.
The **cat** from yesterday says from the dark, “Good night, students.”
We both jump on the **bed**.
The **bed** jumps too.

# 🪄 **Hero School — Episode 3: Flying Lesson Mayhem**

It’s a nice **morning** at Hero School.
The **sky** is blue, the **sun** is warm, and the **students** are scared.
Today we learn how to **fly**.

“Welcome to Flying Class!” says **Harry Potter**.
He stands next to ten **brooms**.
Some are small, one is on fire, and one is eating the **grass**.

“Choose your broom,” says Harry.
I choose the one that looks quiet.
It bites me.

Next to me, **Tony** takes a broom too.
He sneezes.
Now his broom flies to the **moon** without him.

Freddy Krueger laughs.
His broom has **knives** on the front.
He says, “Safety first.”
Everyone steps back.

**Koschei** arrives, wearing a black **helmet** and a long **coat**.
He says, “I do not need a broom. I use my bones.”
Then he jumps — and somehow flies like a skeleton bird.

Harry claps. “Good job, class! Now you try!”

I sit on my broom.
It starts shaking.
I say, “Easy, easy…”
The broom says, “Hold tight!” and goes **up** very fast.

“Whoa!” I shout.
I see the school **roof**, the **trees**, and Tony waving from the **ground**.
Then I see Freddy flying **upside down**, drinking tea.

Suddenly, my broom stops.
Then it goes **down** fast.
I scream, “I’m not ready!”
The broom says, “Me neither!”

Boom!
We land in a small **lake** behind the school.
Water everywhere.
Harry flies over and says, “Good landing! You found the lake!”

I am wet, cold, and proud.
Tony runs to me and laughs.
“You can swim now,” he says.

Later, at lunch, the soup says again, “Eat me, hero.”
I say, “No, thank you. I already drank the lake.”

# 🧪 **Hero School — Episode 4: Potion Problems**

Today we have **Potion Class**.
The room smells like **cheese**, **soap**, and **fire**.
**Harry Potter** is the teacher again.
He says, “Magic is easy — just don’t mix the wrong things.”

Easy?
He gives us bottles with **red**, **blue**, and **green** **liquids**.
He says, “Add two drops. Not three.”
Tony adds four.

Boom!
Smoke fills the room.
Now Tony has **pink hair** and smells like a **lemon**.
Harry says, “Good start!”

**Koschei** brings his own potion.
It’s dark and cold.
He says, “This one makes you live forever.”
Freddy Krueger laughs, “Or die faster.”

I try to make something simple — a cleaning potion.
I mix water, milk, and sugar.
It starts to sing.
The **bottle** jumps on the **table** and shouts, “Hello!”
The whole class laughs.

Then the singing bottle jumps on **Harry’s hat**.
It says, “You are my new home!”
The hat runs away.
Harry runs too.
The bottle sings louder.

Koschei says, “Magic loves music.”
Freddy says, “Magic loves chaos.”
I say, “Magic hates me.”

After class, the floor is wet, the walls are yellow, and everyone smells like fruit salad.
Harry smiles and says, “Perfect! Lesson one complete.”

Tony sneezes again.
The soup turns purple.
We all go home early.

# 😴 **Hero School — Episode 5: Freddy’s Dream Test**

It is **night** at Hero School.
The **moon** is bright, the **wind** is cold.
Everyone sleeps.
Almost everyone.

**Freddy Krueger** walks in the **hall** with his long **knife** hands.
He says, “Time for the Dream Test.”

Suddenly, I am not in my **bed**.
I am in a big dark **forest**.
The **trees** move, the **sky** is red, and the **ground** talks.
The ground says, “Run!”
I run.

I see **Harry Potter** flying in his **pajamas**.
He shouts, “This is not a real class!”
Freddy laughs, “Oh, it is!”

Then I see **Tony**.
He sleeps in the air and still sneezes.
Every time he sneezes, small **fires** start on the **grass**.
Freddy says, “Good power control.”
Tony says, “Thanks, I guess?”

Koschei walks out of a big **tree**.
He looks happy.
He says, “In dreams, I am young again.”
Then he rides a giant **duck** into the sky.
I don’t ask questions anymore.

Now Freddy looks at me.
He says, “Your turn. Show your dream power.”
I think hard.
What can I do here?

I take a deep **breath**, raise my hand, and shout,
“Wake up!”

Boom!
Everything disappears.
I am back in my **bed**, my **room** is cold, and my **cat** sits on my **head**.
It says, “Nice try, hero.”

In the **morning**, Freddy gives me a **note**.
It says:

> “You passed. Never sleep again.”

I smile.
Easy for him to say.

# 🕯️ **Hero School — Episode 6: Koschei’s Secret Room**

It is **evening** at Hero School.
The **hall** is quiet.
The **lights** are off.
Only one **door** is open — the old one under the stairs.

Tony says, “Let’s look inside.”
I say, “No way.”
The **cat** says, “Good idea.”
So we go.

The room is dark and cold.
There are old **books**, **bones**, and many **spiders**.
A small **candle** burns on a **table**.
It smells like soup again.
Why is it always soup here?

On the wall is a big **mirror**.
It shows my **face**, but the mirror version smiles first.
I don’t like that.

Then we hear a strange **voice**:
“Who enters my secret room?”
It is **Koschei**.
He walks from the shadow, wearing his long **black coat**.
He looks angry — or maybe just tired.

Tony says, “We are lost.”
Koschei says, “You are *found*.”
Then he laughs.
His laugh sounds like wind in an empty box.

He points to a big **chest** in the corner.
“Inside,” he says, “is my secret.”
We open it slowly.
Inside is an **egg**.
Just one.

I say, “That’s your secret?”
Koschei nods.
“My life is in this egg.”

Then the egg moves.
It jumps, rolls, and says, “Hi, Dad!”
Tony drops the candle.
The floor starts burning.

Koschei sighs.
“Every century, the egg learns to talk.”

We run out fast.
Behind us, we hear the egg singing a lullaby.
The **door** closes by itself.

Outside, Tony says, “That was crazy.”
I say, “At least we didn’t eat the soup this time.”
