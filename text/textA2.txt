g_text=`A2 Story: **The Strange Evening in the City**

Last Saturday evening, Emma and her best friend Tom decided to go to the city center.
They wanted to drink coffee, talk, and maybe buy something new.

The streets were full of people. Some were shopping, some were eating ice cream, and some were just walking and laughing. The air was warm, and the lights from the shops were bright and colorful.

“Let’s go to the new café near the cinema,” Emma said.
Tom agreed, but he looked at his watch.
“It’s already eight o’clock. I don’t want to miss the last bus home.”

They entered the café. It was small but modern. The music was soft, the chairs were comfortable, and the smell of coffee was wonderful.
Emma ordered a cappuccino, Tom took a hot chocolate, and they shared one big piece of chocolate cake.

While they were talking, something strange happened. A man in a green jacket came in. He was tall, with dark hair and glasses. He looked around, sat at a table near the window, and opened a very old book.

Emma whispered:
“Tom, look at that man. Doesn’t he look mysterious?”
Tom laughed:
“You always think too much. He is just reading.”

But then the man stood up, left some coins on the table, and walked out quickly.
On the chair he left the old book.

Emma and Tom looked at each other.
“What if there is something inside?” Emma said.

They opened the book. On the first page there was a map. The map showed the city, but with strange red marks in different places. On the second page there was a sentence:
“Find the red star and you will find the truth.”

Emma’s eyes were shining.
“This is like a real adventure!”
Tom smiled nervously.
“I think this is just a joke… but maybe we can follow the map?”

Outside the café, the evening was darker now. The city lights looked like stars on the ground. Emma held the book in her hands, Tom carried the cake in a paper box, and together they walked into the night, not sure what they were going to find…

 **The Strange Evening in the City – Part 2**

Emma and Tom walked slowly along the main street.
The book with the map was in Emma’s hands. She looked at it every two minutes.
“Look,” she said, “the first red mark is very close. It’s near the river.”

Tom wasn’t very happy. He wanted to go home, eat pizza, and watch a movie.
But Emma was full of energy.
“You wanted adventure, right?” she asked with a smile.
“I wanted coffee and cake,” Tom answered. He held the paper box with cake like a treasure.

### The Bridge

They arrived at the old stone bridge across the river. The water was dark and fast.
On the map, there was a red star exactly on this bridge.

Emma looked around. There were cars passing, a few people walking, and a man playing guitar near the river.
But nothing looked mysterious.

Suddenly, Tom noticed something under the bridge.
“There! Look! Something is shining.”

They walked down the steps to the riverbank. On a big stone they saw a small metal box. It was old and dirty, but it was locked.
Emma tried to open it, but the lock was too strong.

Tom sighed:
“Of course. A secret box. Classic.”
Emma laughed:
“Come on, this is exciting!”

### The Stranger Again

At that moment, they heard quick steps behind them.
The man in the green jacket was standing there. His glasses were shining in the streetlight.

“You found it,” he said in a quiet voice.
Tom froze. Emma held the book closer.

“What is inside the box?” she asked.
The man smiled mysteriously.
“That is not important. What is important is the choice you make now.”

Emma and Tom looked at each other, confused.
“What choice?” Tom asked.

The man pointed at the map.
“There are more marks. If you continue, you will see more. But sometimes curiosity is dangerous.”

Then he turned and walked away into the dark street, leaving them with the box and the book.

### Decision

For a moment, neither Emma nor Tom said a word. The night was quiet, only the sound of the river and the guitar music in the distance.

Finally, Emma spoke:
“We can’t stop now. This is only the beginning.”
Tom looked at the cake box in his hands, then at Emma, then at the metal box.
He sighed deeply.
“Okay. But if we die, it’s your fault.”

Emma laughed and pushed him gently.
“Don’t be so dramatic. It’s just a game. Or… maybe not.”

Together they walked back to the street. The city was still alive with lights, music, and cars.
In Emma’s hand there was the old book, in Tom’s hand the heavy box, and in their eyes — a big question:
**What would they find next?**
